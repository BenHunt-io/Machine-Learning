### MLProject_ANN
<p> <b> Description: </b> MLProject_ANN is an artificial neural network used for digit & symbol recogonition. The goal was to compute simple math equations from a picture input, but due to time constraints just the predictions from single symbol/digit image inputs were made. The ANN predicts digits and symbols from 28x28 image inputs of handwritten digits and symbols (0-9, +, -). 
The network uses a sigmoid activation function with stochiastic back propogation. Randomly initialzes weights with a normal distribution. Inputs are in the range of 0-256 (grayscale) and downscaled for use in the network to .01 to .99.
<p> <b> Note: </b> The full process is in the write-up in the MLProject_ANN directory </p>
<b> Language: </b> Python with the use of Numpy
