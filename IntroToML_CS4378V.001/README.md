#####MLProject_ANN
<p> MLProject_ANN is an artificial neural network used for digit & symbol recogonition. The goal was to compute simple math equations from a picture input, but due to time constraints <br>
just the predictions from single symbol/digit image inputs were made. The ANN predicts digits and symbols from 28x28 image inputs of handwritten digits and symbols (0-9, +, -). </br>
The network uses a sigmoid activation function with stochiastic back propogation. Randomly initialzes weights with a normal distribution. Inputs are in the range of 0-256 (grayscale)
and downscaled for use in the network to .01 to .99 </p>
<p> The full process is in the write-up in the MLProject_ANN directory </p>
<p> Programmed in Python with the use of Numpy </p>
